Notes for Introduction presentation:

Why R:
Data analysis is a core piece of all sciences, ecology is no exception. Everyone here will be exposed to data in some form this summer and can benefit from learning tools to work with data.
Beyond the summer --> hard to find a career having to do with the sciences where you WONT be working with/analyzing data in some way.

Why a programming language?
- can make tasks easier
- you can do things that you might not otherwise be able to do if you can write your own tools 
- Succinctly - you can be both a user and a developer
- science is about discovering new things and pushing boundaries and often the extant tool don't suffice for this

So, why R?
- Its a common statement/belief that R has a very steep learning curve. In reality, this learning curve has more to do with learning programming for people who have not been exposed to it.
- Often people are taught to DO things in R, not why things are happening.

EXAMPLES:
- Shiny app - MATT
- Leaflet - Luca
- Moving population - Luca


End of introduction:
-Come to class with a laptop
-Install R and RStudio
