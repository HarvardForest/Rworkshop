**Pre-requisites**: experience with using basic computer software

**Required Materials**: laptop or access to some computing device

**Readings**

- [Getting started with R](http://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/#h.nl3rvdr3ycsc)
  is a great, guided introduction to R. We recommend reading through
  this if you would like to get comfortable with some of the concepts
  beforehand. 
- [Noble 2009 PLoS-CB](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424)
  gives a solid overview of how to organize the computer based part of a project. 

**!DISCLAIMER!** *This be not a statistics class!* But, here are
   several great books and resources for learning statistics:

- [Ecological Models and Data in R](http://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/emdbook/index.html)
  [(pdf)](https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/emdbook/book.pdf)
- [A Primer of Ecological Statistics](http://www.sinauer.com/a-primer-of-ecological-statistics.html)
