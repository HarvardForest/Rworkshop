Workshop on Coding in Ecology
Harvard Forest REU, May 2015

When they leave the workshop:
- General data and analytical project management
- Know what R is and does
- Basic function and argument structure
- Data import, manipulation and export
- Where to look for help
- Software best practices

0. Project Management Data and Analytics
- Data management is under-taught in ecology (Strasser and Hampton
2012, Ecosphere)
- Noble 2009
- README, docs, data, src, results, LICENSE
- Calendar
- Understanding what you *did* can often be more useful than understanding
what you're doing.

1. Why learn programming?

- You can help people with code
- Estimated 1.4M CS jobs created over 10 years and an estimated
  400,000 CS graduates https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjKmWk3oE4E

2. What do you need?

- Learn a language
- Script and annotate
- Learn how to break down a task into subtasks
- Why R?
- Ranked 5th among software skill in demand (2014 survey of job search
  websites), open-source and free
- Downloading and installing

3. Fun with the command line
- One is the loneliest number...
- 1 + 1 = ?
- What's a function()?
- Numbers and characters, oh my!
- Vectors and matrices: A romance in N dimensions.

4. Scripting 
- R's built-in editor
- Annotation
- Running scripts (line by line)

5. Working directory (connect to project structure)

6. Debugging (not if, but when...)
- syntax basics (the importance of completion and commas)
- tab completion

7. Basic Analytics
- Data structure and import
- What about meta-data?
- Plotting, scatterplot and barplot
- Statistics (values that tell us about samples: mean, median, mode, range, variance)
- Hypothesis testing (inference beyond our sample)
- t-test and correlation
- p-value

8. Version control
- versions of scripts
- versions of data
- versions of analyses 

9. Aids to Learning
- cheat sheet
- googling
- 

10. Example problem set
- Pulling data from the Harvard Forest Archives
- Analyzing data from texts
- Data simulation

11. Coding ethics
- wikipedia page on hacking
