## Motivation

Science is a multi-step process: once you've designed an experiment and collected
data, the real fun begins! This lesson will teach you how to start this process using
R and RStudio. We will begin with raw data, perform exploratory analyses, and learn
how to plot results graphically. This example starts with a dataset from
[gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org) containing population information for many
countries through time. Can you read the data into R? Can you plot the population for
Senegal? Can you calculate the average income for countries on continent of Asia?
By the end of these lessons you will be able to do things like plot the populations
for all of these countries in under a minute!

## Before Starting The Workshop

Please ensure you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your machine. This is important, as some packages used in the workshop may not install correctly (or at all) if R is not up to date.

[Download and install the latest version of R here](https://www.r-project.org/)
[Download and install RStudio here](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## Introduction to RStudio

Welcome to the R portion of the Software Carpentry workshop.

Throughout this lesson, we're going to teach you some of the fundamentals of
the R language as well as some best practices for organizing code for
scientific projects that will make your life easier.

We'll be using RStudio: a free, open source R integrated development
environment. It provides a built in editor, works on all platforms (including
on servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version
control and project management.



**Basic layout**

When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

  * The interactive R console (entire left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

![RStudio layout](../fig/01-rstudio.png)

Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open
in the top left.

![RStudio layout with .R file open](../fig/01-rstudio-script.png)


## Work flow within RStudio
There are two main ways one can work within RStudio.

1. Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into
a .R file to run later.
   *  This works well when doing small tests and initially starting off.
   *  It quickly becomes laborious
2. Start writing in an .R file and use RStudio's command / short cut
to push current line, selected lines or modified lines to the
interactive R console.
   * This is a great way to start; all your code is saved for later
   * You will be able to run the file you create from within RStudio
   or using R's `source()`  function.

> ## Tip: Running segments of your code
>
> RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor
> window. There are buttons, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts. To run the
> current line, you can 1. click on the `Run` button above the editor panel,
> or 2. select "Run Lines" from the "Code" menu, or 3. hit Ctrl-Enter in Windows
> or Linux or Command-Enter on OS X. (This shortcut can also be seen by hovering
> the mouse over the button). To run a block of code, select it and then `Run`.
> If you have modified a line of code within a block of code you have just run,
> there is no need to reselct the section and `Run`, you can use the next button
> along, `Re-run the previous region`. This will run the previous code block
> including the modifications you have made.

## Introduction to R

Much of your time in R will be spent in the R interactive
console. This is where you will run all of your code, and can be a
useful environment to try out ideas before adding them to an R script
file. This console in RStudio is the same as the one you would get if
you typed in `R` in your command-line environment.

The first thing you will see in the R interactive session is a bunch
of information, followed by a ">" and a blinking cursor. In many ways
this is similar to the shell environment you learned about during the
shell lessons: it operates on the same idea of a "Read, evaluate,
print loop": you type in commands, R tries to execute them, and then
returns a result.

## Using R as a calculator

The simplest thing you could do with R is do arithmetic:


~~~
1 + 100
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 101
~~~
{: .output}

And R will print out the answer, with a preceding "[1]". Don't worry about this
for now, we'll explain that later. For now think of it as indicating output.

Like bash, if you type in an incomplete command, R will wait for you to
complete it:

~~~
> 1 +
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
+
~~~
{: .output}

Any time you hit return and the R session shows a "+" instead of a ">", it
means it's waiting for you to complete the command. If you want to cancel
a command you can simply hit "Esc" and RStudio will give you back the ">"
prompt.

> ## Tip: Cancelling commands
>
> If you're using R from the commandline instead of from within RStudio,
> you need to use `Ctrl+C` instead of `Esc` to cancel the command. This
> applies to Mac users as well!
>
> Cancelling a command isn't only useful for killing incomplete commands:
> you can also use it to tell R to stop running code (for example if it's
> taking much longer than you expect), or to get rid of the code you're
> currently writing.
>
{: .callout}

When using R as a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you
would have learned back in school.

From highest to lowest precedence:

 * Parentheses: `(`, `)`
 * Exponents: `^` or `**`
 * Divide: `/`
 * Multiply: `*`
 * Add: `+`
 * Subtract: `-`


~~~
3 + 5 * 2
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 13
~~~
{: .output}

Use parentheses to group operations in order to force the order of
evaluation if it differs from the default, or to make clear what you
intend.


~~~
(3 + 5) * 2
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 16
~~~
{: .output}

This can get unwieldy when not needed, but  clarifies your intentions.
Remember that others may later read your code.


~~~
(3 + (5 * (2 ^ 2))) # hard to read
3 + 5 * 2 ^ 2       # clear, if you remember the rules
3 + 5 * (2 ^ 2)     # if you forget some rules, this might help
~~~
{: .r}


The text after each line of code is called a
"comment". Anything that follows after the hash (or octothorpe) symbol
`#` is ignored by R when it executes code.

Really small or large numbers get a scientific notation:


~~~
2/10000
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 2e-04
~~~
{: .output}

Which is shorthand for "multiplied by `10^XX`". So `2e-4`
is shorthand for `2 * 10^(-4)`.

You can write numbers in scientific notation too:


~~~
5e3  # Note the lack of minus here
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 5000
~~~
{: .output}

## Mathematical functions

R has many built in mathematical functions. To call a function,
we simply type its name, followed by  open and closing parentheses.
Anything we type inside the parentheses is called the function's
arguments:


~~~
sin(1)  # trigonometry functions
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 0.841471
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
log(1)  # natural logarithm
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 0
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
log10(10) # base-10 logarithm
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 1
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
exp(0.5) # e^(1/2)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 1.648721
~~~
{: .output}

Don't worry about trying to remember every function in R. You
can simply look them up on Google, or if you can remember the
start of the function's name, use the tab completion in RStudio.

This is one advantage that RStudio has over R on its own, it
has auto-completion abilities that allow you to more easily
look up functions, their arguments, and the values that they
take.

Typing a `?` before the name of a command will open the help page
for that command. As well as providing a detailed description of
the command and how it works, scrolling to the bottom of the
help page will usually show a collection of code examples which
illustrate command usage. We'll go through an example later.

## Comparing things

We can also do comparison in R:


~~~
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 < 2  # less than
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 <= 1  # less than or equal to
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 > 0  # greater than
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}

{: .callout}

## Variables and assignment

We can store values in variables using the assignment operator `<-`, like this:


~~~
x <- 1/40
~~~
{: .r}

Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored it for later
in something called a **variable**. `x` now contains the **value** `0.025`:


~~~
x
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 0.025
~~~
{: .output}

More precisely, the stored value is a *decimal approximation* of
this fraction called a [floating point number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point).

Look for the `Environment` tab in one of the panes of RStudio, and you will see that `x` and its value
have appeared. Our variable `x` can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number:


~~~
log(x)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] -3.688879
~~~
{: .output}

Notice also that variables can be reassigned:


~~~
x <- 100
~~~
{: .r}

`x` used to contain the value 0.025 and and now it has the value 100.

Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to:


~~~
x <- x + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
~~~
{: .r}

The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.
The right hand side is *fully evaluated* before the assignment occurs.

Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. They
cannot start with a number nor contain spaces at all. Different people use
different conventions for long variable names, these include

  * periods.between.words
  * underscores\_between_words
  * camelCaseToSeparateWords

What you use is up to you, but **be consistent**.

It is also possible to use the `=` operator for assignment:


~~~
x = 1/40
~~~
{: .r}

But this is much less common among R users.  The most important thing is to
**be consistent** with the operator you use. There are occasionally places
where it is less confusing to use `<-` than `=`, and it is the most common
symbol used in the community. So the recommendation is to use `<-`.

## Vectorization

One final thing to be aware of is that R is *vectorized*, meaning that
variables and functions can have vectors as values. For example


~~~
1:5
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
2^(1:5)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1]  2  4  8 16 32
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
x <- 1:5
2^x
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1]  2  4  8 16 32
~~~
{: .output}

This is incredibly powerful; we will discuss this further in an
upcoming lesson.


## Managing your environment

There are a few useful commands you can use to interact with the R session.

`ls` will list all of the variables and functions stored in the global environment
(your working R session):


~~~
ls()
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "x" "y"
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Tip: hidden objects
>
> Like in the shell, `ls` will hide any variables or functions starting
> with a "." by default. To list all objects, type `ls(all.names=TRUE)`
> instead
>
{: .callout}

Note here that we didn't given any arguments to `ls`, but we still
needed to give the parentheses to tell R to call the function.

If we type `ls` by itself, R will print out the source code for that function!


~~~
ls
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
function (name, pos = -1L, envir = as.environment(pos), all.names = FALSE, 
    pattern, sorted = TRUE) 
{
    if (!missing(name)) {
        pos <- tryCatch(name, error = function(e) e)
        if (inherits(pos, "error")) {
            name <- substitute(name)
            if (!is.character(name)) 
                name <- deparse(name)
            warning(gettextf("%s converted to character string", 
                sQuote(name)), domain = NA)
            pos <- name
        }
    }
    all.names <- .Internal(ls(envir, all.names, sorted))
    if (!missing(pattern)) {
        if ((ll <- length(grep("[", pattern, fixed = TRUE))) && 
            ll != length(grep("]", pattern, fixed = TRUE))) {
            if (pattern == "[") {
                pattern <- "\\["
                warning("replaced regular expression pattern '[' by  '\\\\['")
            }
            else if (length(grep("[^\\\\]\\[<-", pattern))) {
                pattern <- sub("\\[<-", "\\\\\\[<-", pattern)
                warning("replaced '[<-' by '\\\\[<-' in regular expression pattern")
            }
        }
        grep(pattern, all.names, value = TRUE)
    }
    else all.names
}
<bytecode: 0x000000000471c200>
<environment: namespace:base>
~~~
{: .output}

You can use `rm` to delete objects you no longer need:


~~~
rm(x)
~~~
{: .r}

If you have lots of things in your environment and want to delete all of them,
you can pass the results of `ls` to the `rm` function:


~~~
rm(list = ls())
~~~
{: .r}

In this case we've combined the two. Like the order of operations, anything
inside the innermost parentheses is evaluated first, and so on.

In this case we've specified that the results of `ls` should be used for the
`list` argument in `rm`. When assigning values to arguments by name, you *must*
use the `=` operator!!

If instead we use `<-`, there will be unintended side effects, or you may get an error message:


~~~
rm(list <- ls())
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
Error in rm(list <- ls()): ... must contain names or character strings
~~~
{: .error}

> ## Tip: Warnings vs. Errors

> Pay attention when R does something unexpected! Errors, like above,
> are thrown when R cannot proceed with a calculation. Warnings on the
> other hand usually mean that the function has run, but it probably
> hasn't worked as expected.
>
> In both cases, the message that R prints out usually give you clues
> how to fix a problem.
>
{: .callout}

## R Packages

It is possible to add functions to R by writing a package, or by
obtaining a package written by someone else. As of this writing, there
are over 10,000 packages available on CRAN (the comprehensive R archive
network). R and RStudio have functionality for managing packages:

* You can see what packages are installed by typing
  `installed.packages()`
* You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
* You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
* You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
* You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`

## Introduction

The scientific process is naturally incremental, and many projects
start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and
eventually everything is a bit mixed together.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Managing your projects in a reproducible fashion doesn't just make your science reproducible, it makes your life easier.</p>— Vince Buffalo (@vsbuffalo) <a href="https://twitter.com/vsbuffalo/status/323638476153167872">April 15, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Most people tend to organize their projects like this:

![](../fig/bad_layout.png)

There are many reasons why we should *ALWAYS* avoid this:

1. It is really hard to tell which version of your data is
the original and which is the modified;
2. It gets really messy because it mixes files with various
extensions together;
3. It probably takes you a lot of time to actually find
things, and relate the correct figures to the exact code
that has been used to generate it;

A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:

* It will help ensure the integrity of your data;
* It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else
(a lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);
* It allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;
* It makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break.

## A possible solution

Fortunately, there are tools and packages which can help you manage your work effectively.

One of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is its project management
functionality. We'll be using this today to create a self-contained, reproducible
project.


> ## Challenge: Creating a self-contained project
>
> We're going to create a new project in RStudio:
>
> 1. Click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
> 2. Click "New Directory".
> 3. Click "Empty Project".
> 4. Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g. "my_project".
> 5. Make sure that the checkbox for "Create a git repository" is selected.
> 6. Click the "Create Project" button.
{: .challenge}

Now when we start R in this project directory, or open this project with RStudio,
all of our work on this project will be entirely self-contained in this directory.

## Best practices for project organization

Although there is no "best" way to lay out a project, there are some general
principles to adhere to that will make project management easier:

### Treat data as read only

This is probably the most important goal of setting up a project. Data is
typically time consuming and/or expensive to collect. Working with them
interactively (e.g., in Excel) where they can be modified means you are never
sure of where the data came from, or how it has been modified since collection.
It is therefore a good idea to treat your data as "read-only".

### Data Cleaning

In many cases your data will be "dirty": it will need significant preprocessing
to get into a format R (or any other programming language) will find useful. This
task is sometimes called "data munging". I find it useful to store these scripts
in a separate folder, and create a second "read-only" data folder to hold the
"cleaned" data sets.

### Treat generated output as disposable

Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable: it should
all be able to be regenerated from your scripts.

There are lots of different ways to manage this output. I find it useful to
have an output folder with different sub-directories for each separate
analysis. This makes it easier later, as many of my analyses are exploratory
and don't end up being used in the final project, and some of the analyses
get shared between projects.

> ## Tip: Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing
>
> [Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing](https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf) gives the following recommendations for project organization:
>
> 1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
> 2. Put text documents associated with the project in the `doc` directory.
> 3. Put raw data and metadata in the `data` directory, and files generated during cleanup and analysis in a `results` directory.
> 4. Put source for the project's scripts and programs in the `src` directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or compiled locally in the `bin` directory.
> 5. Name all files to reflect their content or function.

> ## Tip: ProjectTemplate - a possible solution
>
> One way to automate the management of projects is to install the third-party package, `ProjectTemplate`.
> This package will set up an ideal directory structure for project management.
> This is very useful as it enables you to have your analysis pipeline/workflow organised and structured.
> Together with the default RStudio project functionality and Git you will be able to keep track of your
> work as well as be able to share your work with collaborators.

> ~~~
> {: .r}
>

{: .callout}

### Separate function definition and application

The most effective way I find to work in R, is to play around in the interactive
session, then copy commands across to a script file when I'm sure they work and
do what I want. You can also save all the commands you've entered using the
`history` command, but I don't find it useful because when I'm typing its 90%
trial and error.

When your project is new and shiny, the script file usually contains many lines
of directly executed code. As it matures, reusable chunks get pulled into their
own functions. It's a good idea to separate these into separate folders; one
to store useful functions that you'll reuse across analyses and projects, and
one to store the analysis scripts.

> ## Tip: avoiding duplication
>
> You may find yourself using data or analysis scripts across several projects.
> Typically you want to avoid duplication to save space and avoid having to
> make updates to code in multiple places.
>
> In this case I find it useful to make "symbolic links", which are essentially

### Save the data in the data directory

Now we have a good directory structure we will now place/save the data file in the `data/` directory.

### Version Control

We also set up our project to integrate with git, putting it under version control.
RStudio has a nicer interface to git than shell, but is very limited in what it can
do, so you will find yourself occasionally needing to use the shell. Let's go
through and make an initial commit of our template files.

The workspace/history pane has a tab for "Git". We can stage each file by checking the box:
you will see a green "A" next to stage files and folders, and yellow question marks next to
files or folders git doesn't know about yet. RStudio also nicely shows you the difference
between files from different commits.

title: "Seeking Help"
teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How can I get help in R?"
objectives:
- "To be able read R help files for functions and special operators."
- "To be able to use CRAN task views to identify packages to solve a problem."
- "To be able to seek help from your peers."
keypoints:
- "Use `help()` to get online help in R."
---



## Reading Help files

R, and every package, provide help files for functions. To search for help on a
function from a specific function that is in a package loaded into your
namespace (your interactive R session):


~~~
?function_name
help(function_name)
~~~
{: .r}

This will load up a help page in RStudio (or as plain text in R by itself).

Each help page is broken down into sections:

 - Description: An extended description of what the function does.
 - Usage: The arguments of the function and their default values.
 - Arguments: An explanation of the data each argument is expecting.
 - Details: Any important details to be aware of.
 - Value: The data the function returns.
 - See Also: Any related functions you might find useful.
 - Examples: Some examples for how to use the function.

Different functions might have different sections, but these are the main ones you should be aware of.

> ## Tip: Reading help files
>
> One of the most daunting aspects of R is the large number of functions
> available. It would be prohibitive, if not impossible to remember the
> correct usage for every function you use. Luckily, the help files
> mean you don't have to!
{: .callout}

## Special Operators

To seek help on special operators, use quotes:


~~~
?"+"
~~~
{: .r}

## Getting help on packages

Many packages come with "vignettes": tutorials and extended example documentation.
Without any arguments, `vignette()` will list all vignettes for all installed packages;
`vignette(package="package-name")` will list all available vignettes for
`package-name`, and `vignette("vignette-name")` will open the specified vignette.

If a package doesn't have any vignettes, you can usually find help by typing
`help("package-name")`.

## When you kind of remember the function

If you're not sure what package a function is in, or how it's specifically spelled you can do a fuzzy search:


~~~
??function_name
~~~
{: .r}

## When you have no idea where to begin

If you don't know what function or package you need to use
[CRAN Task Views](http://cran.at.r-project.org/web/views)
is a specially maintained list of packages grouped into
fields. This can be a good starting point.

## When your code doesn't work: seeking help from your peers

If you're having trouble using a function, 9 times out of 10,
the answers you are seeking have already been answered on
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). You can search using
the `[r]` tag.

If you can't find the answer, there are a few useful functions to
help you ask a question from your peers:


~~~
?dput
~~~
{: .r}

Will dump the data you're working with into a format so that it can
be copy and pasted by anyone else into their R session.


~~~
sessionInfo()
~~~
{: .r}



~~~

## Motivation

Science is a multi-step process: once you've designed an experiment and collected
data, the real fun begins! This lesson will teach you how to start this process using
R and RStudio. We will begin with raw data, perform exploratory analyses, and learn
how to plot results graphically. This example starts with a dataset from
[gapminder.org](https://www.gapminder.org) containing population information for many
countries through time. Can you read the data into R? Can you plot the population for
Senegal? Can you calculate the average income for countries on continent of Asia?
By the end of these lessons you will be able to do things like plot the populations
for all of these countries in under a minute!

## Before Starting The Workshop

Please ensure you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your machine. This is important, as some packages used in the workshop may not install correctly (or at all) if R is not up to date.

[Download and install the latest version of R here](https://www.r-project.org/)
[Download and install RStudio here](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## Introduction to RStudio

Welcome to the R portion of the Software Carpentry workshop.

Throughout this lesson, we're going to teach you some of the fundamentals of
the R language as well as some best practices for organizing code for
scientific projects that will make your life easier.

We'll be using RStudio: a free, open source R integrated development
environment. It provides a built in editor, works on all platforms (including
on servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version
control and project management.



**Basic layout**

When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

  * The interactive R console (entire left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

![RStudio layout](../fig/01-rstudio.png)

Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open
in the top left.

![RStudio layout with .R file open](../fig/01-rstudio-script.png)


## Work flow within RStudio
There are two main ways one can work within RStudio.

1. Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into
a .R file to run later.
   *  This works well when doing small tests and initially starting off.
   *  It quickly becomes laborious
2. Start writing in an .R file and use RStudio's command / short cut
to push current line, selected lines or modified lines to the
interactive R console.
   * This is a great way to start; all your code is saved for later
   * You will be able to run the file you create from within RStudio
   or using R's `source()`  function.

> ## Tip: Running segments of your code
>
> RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor
> window. There are buttons, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts. To run the
> current line, you can 1. click on the `Run` button above the editor panel,
> or 2. select "Run Lines" from the "Code" menu, or 3. hit Ctrl-Enter in Windows
> or Linux or Command-Enter on OS X. (This shortcut can also be seen by hovering
> the mouse over the button). To run a block of code, select it and then `Run`.
> If you have modified a line of code within a block of code you have just run,
> there is no need to reselct the section and `Run`, you can use the next button
> along, `Re-run the previous region`. This will run the previous code block
> including the modifications you have made.

## Introduction to R

Much of your time in R will be spent in the R interactive
console. This is where you will run all of your code, and can be a
useful environment to try out ideas before adding them to an R script
file. This console in RStudio is the same as the one you would get if
you typed in `R` in your command-line environment.

The first thing you will see in the R interactive session is a bunch
of information, followed by a ">" and a blinking cursor. In many ways
this is similar to the shell environment you learned about during the
shell lessons: it operates on the same idea of a "Read, evaluate,
print loop": you type in commands, R tries to execute them, and then
returns a result.

## Using R as a calculator

The simplest thing you could do with R is do arithmetic:


~~~
1 + 100
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 101
~~~
{: .output}

And R will print out the answer, with a preceding "[1]". Don't worry about this
for now, we'll explain that later. For now think of it as indicating output.

Like bash, if you type in an incomplete command, R will wait for you to
complete it:

~~~
> 1 +
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
+
~~~
{: .output}

Any time you hit return and the R session shows a "+" instead of a ">", it
means it's waiting for you to complete the command. If you want to cancel
a command you can simply hit "Esc" and RStudio will give you back the ">"
prompt.

> ## Tip: Cancelling commands
>
> If you're using R from the commandline instead of from within RStudio,
> you need to use `Ctrl+C` instead of `Esc` to cancel the command. This
> applies to Mac users as well!
>
> Cancelling a command isn't only useful for killing incomplete commands:
> you can also use it to tell R to stop running code (for example if it's
> taking much longer than you expect), or to get rid of the code you're
> currently writing.
>
{: .callout}

When using R as a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you
would have learned back in school.

From highest to lowest precedence:

 * Parentheses: `(`, `)`
 * Exponents: `^` or `**`
 * Divide: `/`
 * Multiply: `*`
 * Add: `+`
 * Subtract: `-`


~~~
3 + 5 * 2
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 13
~~~
{: .output}

Use parentheses to group operations in order to force the order of
evaluation if it differs from the default, or to make clear what you
intend.


~~~
(3 + 5) * 2
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 16
~~~
{: .output}

This can get unwieldy when not needed, but  clarifies your intentions.
Remember that others may later read your code.


~~~
(3 + (5 * (2 ^ 2))) # hard to read
3 + 5 * 2 ^ 2       # clear, if you remember the rules
3 + 5 * (2 ^ 2)     # if you forget some rules, this might help
~~~
{: .r}


The text after each line of code is called a
"comment". Anything that follows after the hash (or octothorpe) symbol
`#` is ignored by R when it executes code.

Really small or large numbers get a scientific notation:


~~~
2/10000
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 2e-04
~~~
{: .output}

Which is shorthand for "multiplied by `10^XX`". So `2e-4`
is shorthand for `2 * 10^(-4)`.

You can write numbers in scientific notation too:


~~~
5e3  # Note the lack of minus here
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 5000
~~~
{: .output}

## Mathematical functions

R has many built in mathematical functions. To call a function,
we simply type its name, followed by  open and closing parentheses.
Anything we type inside the parentheses is called the function's
arguments:


~~~
sin(1)  # trigonometry functions
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 0.841471
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
log(1)  # natural logarithm
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 0
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
log10(10) # base-10 logarithm
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 1
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
exp(0.5) # e^(1/2)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 1.648721
~~~
{: .output}

Don't worry about trying to remember every function in R. You
can simply look them up on Google, or if you can remember the
start of the function's name, use the tab completion in RStudio.

This is one advantage that RStudio has over R on its own, it
has auto-completion abilities that allow you to more easily
look up functions, their arguments, and the values that they
take.

Typing a `?` before the name of a command will open the help page
for that command. As well as providing a detailed description of
the command and how it works, scrolling to the bottom of the
help page will usually show a collection of code examples which
illustrate command usage. We'll go through an example later.

## Comparing things

We can also do comparison in R:


~~~
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 < 2  # less than
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 <= 1  # less than or equal to
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 > 0  # greater than
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Tip: Comparing Numbers
>
> A word of warning about comparing numbers: you should
> never use `==` to compare two numbers unless they are
> integers (a data type which can specifically represent
> only whole numbers).

> Computers may only represent decimal numbers with a

## Variables and assignment

We can store values in variables using the assignment operator `<-`, like this:


~~~
x <- 1/40
~~~
{: .r}

Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored it for later
in something called a **variable**. `x` now contains the **value** `0.025`:


~~~
x
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 0.025
~~~
{: .output}

More precisely, the stored value is a *decimal approximation* of
this fraction called a [floating point number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point).

Look for the `Environment` tab in one of the panes of RStudio, and you will see that `x` and its value
have appeared. Our variable `x` can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number:


~~~
log(x)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] -3.688879
~~~
{: .output}

Notice also that variables can be reassigned:


~~~
x <- 100
~~~
{: .r}

`x` used to contain the value 0.025 and and now it has the value 100.

Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to:


~~~
x <- x + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
~~~
{: .r}

The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.
The right hand side is *fully evaluated* before the assignment occurs.

Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. They
cannot start with a number nor contain spaces at all. Different people use
different conventions for long variable names, these include

  * periods.between.words
  * underscores\_between_words
  * camelCaseToSeparateWords

What you use is up to you, but **be consistent**.

It is also possible to use the `=` operator for assignment:


~~~
x = 1/40
~~~
{: .r}

But this is much less common among R users.  The most important thing is to
**be consistent** with the operator you use. There are occasionally places
where it is less confusing to use `<-` than `=`, and it is the most common
symbol used in the community. So the recommendation is to use `<-`.

## Vectorization

One final thing to be aware of is that R is *vectorized*, meaning that
variables and functions can have vectors as values. For example


~~~
1:5
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
2^(1:5)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1]  2  4  8 16 32
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
x <- 1:5
2^x
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1]  2  4  8 16 32
~~~
{: .output}

This is incredibly powerful; we will discuss this further in an
upcoming lesson.


## Managing your environment

There are a few useful commands you can use to interact with the R session.

`ls` will list all of the variables and functions stored in the global environment
(your working R session):


~~~
ls()
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "x"
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Tip: hidden objects
>
> Like in the shell, `ls` will hide any variables or functions starting
> with a "." by default. To list all objects, type `ls(all.names=TRUE)`
> instead
>
{: .callout}

Note here that we didn't given any arguments to `ls`, but we still
needed to give the parentheses to tell R to call the function.

If we type `ls` by itself, R will print out the source code for that function!


~~~
ls
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
function (name, pos = -1L, envir = as.environment(pos), all.names = FALSE, 
    pattern, sorted = TRUE) 
{
    if (!missing(name)) {
        pos <- tryCatch(name, error = function(e) e)
        if (inherits(pos, "error")) {
            name <- substitute(name)

You can use `rm` to delete objects you no longer need:


~~~
rm(x)
~~~
{: .r}

If you have lots of things in your environment and want to delete all of them,
you can pass the results of `ls` to the `rm` function:


~~~
rm(list = ls())
~~~
{: .r}

In this case we've combined the two. Like the order of operations, anything
inside the innermost parentheses is evaluated first, and so on.

In this case we've specified that the results of `ls` should be used for the
`list` argument in `rm`. When assigning values to arguments by name, you *must*
use the `=` operator!!

If instead we use `<-`, there will be unintended side effects, or you may get an error message:


~~~
rm(list <- ls())
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
Error in rm(list <- ls()): ... must contain names or character strings
~~~
{: .error}

## R Packages

It is possible to add functions to R by writing a package, or by
obtaining a package written by someone else. As of this writing, there
are over 10,000 packages available on CRAN (the comprehensive R archive
network). R and RStudio have functionality for managing packages:

* You can see what packages are installed by typing
  `installed.packages()`
* You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
* You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
* You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
* You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`

## Introduction

The scientific process is naturally incremental, and many projects
start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and
eventually everything is a bit mixed together.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Managing your projects in a reproducible fashion doesn't just make your science reproducible, it makes your life easier.</p>— Vince Buffalo (@vsbuffalo) <a href="https://twitter.com/vsbuffalo/status/323638476153167872">April 15, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Most people tend to organize their projects like this:

![](../fig/bad_layout.png)

There are many reasons why we should *ALWAYS* avoid this:

1. It is really hard to tell which version of your data is
the original and which is the modified;
2. It gets really messy because it mixes files with various
extensions together;
3. It probably takes you a lot of time to actually find
things, and relate the correct figures to the exact code
that has been used to generate it;

A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:

* It will help ensure the integrity of your data;
* It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else
(a lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);
* It allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;
* It makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break.

## A possible solution

Fortunately, there are tools and packages which can help you manage your work effectively.

One of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is its project management
functionality. We'll be using this today to create a self-contained, reproducible
project.


> ## Challenge: Creating a self-contained project
>
> We're going to create a new project in RStudio:
>
> 1. Click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
> 2. Click "New Directory".
> 3. Click "Empty Project".
> 4. Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g. "my_project".
> 5. Make sure that the checkbox for "Create a git repository" is selected.
> 6. Click the "Create Project" button.
{: .challenge}

Now when we start R in this project directory, or open this project with RStudio,
all of our work on this project will be entirely self-contained in this directory.

## Best practices for project organization

Although there is no "best" way to lay out a project, there are some general
principles to adhere to that will make project management easier:

### Treat data as read only

This is probably the most important goal of setting up a project. Data is
typically time consuming and/or expensive to collect. Working with them
interactively (e.g., in Excel) where they can be modified means you are never
sure of where the data came from, or how it has been modified since collection.
It is therefore a good idea to treat your data as "read-only".

### Data Cleaning

In many cases your data will be "dirty": it will need significant preprocessing
to get into a format R (or any other programming language) will find useful. This
task is sometimes called "data munging". I find it useful to store these scripts
in a separate folder, and create a second "read-only" data folder to hold the
"cleaned" data sets.

### Treat generated output as disposable

Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable: it should
all be able to be regenerated from your scripts.

There are lots of different ways to manage this output. I find it useful to
have an output folder with different sub-directories for each separate
analysis. This makes it easier later, as many of my analyses are exploratory
and don't end up being used in the final project, and some of the analyses
get shared between projects.

> ## Tip: Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing
>
> [Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing](https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf) gives the following recommendations for project organization:
>
> 1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
> 2. Put text documents associated with the project in the `doc` directory.
> 3. Put raw data and metadata in the `data` directory, and files generated during cleanup and analysis in a `results` directory.
> 4. Put source for the project's scripts and programs in the `src` directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or compiled locally in the `bin` directory.
> 5. Name all files to reflect their content or function.

> ## Tip: ProjectTemplate - a possible solution
>
> One way to automate the management of projects is to install the third-party package, `ProjectTemplate`.
> This package will set up an ideal directory structure for project management.
> This is very useful as it enables you to have your analysis pipeline/workflow organised and structured.

> work as well as be able to share your work with collaborators.

> ~~~
> {: .r}
>
> For more information on ProjectTemplate and its functionality visit the
> home page [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/index.html)
{: .callout}

### Separate function definition and application

The most effective way I find to work in R, is to play around in the interactive
session, then copy commands across to a script file when I'm sure they work and
do what I want. You can also save all the commands you've entered using the
`history` command, but I don't find it useful because when I'm typing its 90%
trial and error.

When your project is new and shiny, the script file usually contains many lines
of directly executed code. As it matures, reusable chunks get pulled into their
own functions. It's a good idea to separate these into separate folders; one
to store useful functions that you'll reuse across analyses and projects, and
one to store the analysis scripts.

> ## Tip: avoiding duplication
>
> You may find yourself using data or analysis scripts across several projects.
> Typically you want to avoid duplication to save space and avoid having to
> make updates to code in multiple places.
>
> In this case I find it useful to make "symbolic links", which are essentially
> shortcuts to files somewhere else on a filesystem. On Linux and OS X you can
> use the `ln -s` command, and on Windows you can either create a shortcut or
> use the `mklink` command from the windows terminal.
{: .callout}

### Save the data in the data directory

Now we have a good directory structure we will now place/save the data file in the `data/` directory.

> ## Challenge 1
> Download the gapminder data from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv).

> 2. Make sure it's saved under the name `gapminder-FiveYearData.csv`
> 3. Save the file in the `data/` folder within your project.
>
> We will load and inspect these data later.

### Version Control

We also set up our project to integrate with git, putting it under version control.
RStudio has a nicer interface to git than shell, but is very limited in what it can
do, so you will find yourself occasionally needing to use the shell. Let's go
through and make an initial commit of our template files.

The workspace/history pane has a tab for "Git". We can stage each file by checking the box:
you will see a green "A" next to stage files and folders, and yellow question marks next to
files or folders git doesn't know about yet. RStudio also nicely shows you the difference
between files from different commits.

## Reading Help files

R, and every package, provide help files for functions. To search for help on a
function from a specific function that is in a package loaded into your
namespace (your interactive R session):


~~~
?function_name
help(function_name)
~~~
{: .r}

This will load up a help page in RStudio (or as plain text in R by itself).

Each help page is broken down into sections:

 - Description: An extended description of what the function does.
 - Usage: The arguments of the function and their default values.
 - Arguments: An explanation of the data each argument is expecting.
 - Details: Any important details to be aware of.
 - Value: The data the function returns.
 - See Also: Any related functions you might find useful.
 - Examples: Some examples for how to use the function.

Different functions might have different sections, but these are the main ones you should be aware of.

> ## Tip: Reading help files
>
> One of the most daunting aspects of R is the large number of functions
> available. It would be prohibitive, if not impossible to remember the
> correct usage for every function you use. Luckily, the help files
> mean you don't have to!
{: .callout}

## Special Operators

To seek help on special operators, use quotes:


~~~
?"+"
~~~
{: .r}

## Getting help on packages

Many packages come with "vignettes": tutorials and extended example documentation.
Without any arguments, `vignette()` will list all vignettes for all installed packages;
`vignette(package="package-name")` will list all available vignettes for
`package-name`, and `vignette("vignette-name")` will open the specified vignette.

If a package doesn't have any vignettes, you can usually find help by typing
`help("package-name")`.

## When you kind of remember the function

If you're not sure what package a function is in, or how it's specifically spelled you can do a fuzzy search:


~~~
??function_name
~~~
{: .r}

## When you have no idea where to begin

If you don't know what function or package you need to use
[CRAN Task Views](http://cran.at.r-project.org/web/views)
is a specially maintained list of packages grouped into
fields. This can be a good starting point.

## When your code doesn't work: seeking help from your peers

If you're having trouble using a function, 9 times out of 10,
the answers you are seeking have already been answered on
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). You can search using
the `[r]` tag.

If you can't find the answer, there are a few useful functions to
help you ask a question from your peers:


~~~
?dput
~~~
{: .r}

Will dump the data you're working with into a format so that it can
be copy and pasted by anyone else into their R session.


~~~
sessionInfo()
~~~
{: .r}
