*Goal*: Students will learn how to use the R programming language for
 ecological analyses and gain experience with:

- Managing analytical aspects of a project
- Inputing, manipulating and exporting data
- Statistical functions
- Exploring data patterns
- Coding and software best practices
- Getting more help, experience and practice

Class Schedule
--------------

Brief intro to ecological analyses.

- Why program? 
- Brief introduction to project management
- Connect to syllabus and course materials

**First Meeting**

**Location: Fisher Museum**

**Time: TBD**

*Before Class*

- Connect to Harvard Forest wireless
- Install R on your computer: http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/*
- Download the example project: https://github.com/HarvardForest/myProject/archive/master.zip

- Analytics project framework 
<!-- (Noble 2009 =  -->
<!--   document organization, task scheduling, data management, analytics -->
<!--   management, keeping an analytics notebook) -->
- Operations
- Objects 
- Functions
- Scripting and annotation (Save Our Source!)
- Setting the working directory

*Post-Class Challenge*

- Explore the HF data archive and find a dataset relevant to your
project.
- Make sure to read the data ownership information!

**Second Meeting**

**Location: Fisher Museum**

**Time: TBD**

- Entering data by hand
- Manipulating vectors (sorting, ordering)
- Manipulating matrices (sorting, appending)
- Inputting data (read.csv,read.table)
- Advanced data = lists

*Post-Class Challenge*

- Write a function that will import your HF dataset into R.

**Third Meeting**

**Location: Fisher Museum**

**Time: TBD**

- Overview of data visualization
- Calculating basic statistics (mean and variance)
- Writing your own functions (se: input, process, output)
- What are packages? (e.g., *gplot*)
- Barplot with error bars

*Post-Class Challenge*

- Write a script that will import your HF dataset and conduct analyses
  on the data.

**Fourth/Last Meeting**

**Location: Fisher Museum**

**Time: TBD**

- Organizing code
- Getting data from the HF archives
- Loops and applys
- Versioning with github
- Simulating data (runif and rnorm)
- Data provenance


*Post-Class Challenge*

- Think of an ecological question/challenge that might be addressed
  with software
- Summer Hackathon?
- [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org)
