*Instructor*: Matthew Lau (http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~matthewklau)

Students will learn how to use programming for ecological analyses
using the R programming language and gain experience:

+ Managing analytical aspects of a project
+ Inputting, manipulating and exporting data
+ Statistical functions
+ Plotting data patterns
+ Coding and software best practices
+ Getting more help, experience and practice

**Although statistics will be introduced very
briefly, this will not be a statistics class.**

*Pre-requisites*: experience with using basic computer software.
*Required Materials*: laptop or access to some computing device.
