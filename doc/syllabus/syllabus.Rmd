Ecological Analytics with R
===========================

<!-- render('syllabus.Rmd',);render('syllabus.Rmd',output_format='pdf_document') -->

*Location*: Harvard Forest, Fisher Museum

*Instructor*: Matthew Lau (http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~matthewklau)

*Goal*: Students will learn how to use the R programming language for
 ecological analyses and gain experience:

- Managing analytical aspects of a project
- Inputting, manipulating and exporting data
- Statistical functions
- Plotting data patterns
- Coding and software best practices
- Getting more help, experience and practice

**Although statistics will be introduced very
briefly, this will not be a statistics class.**

*Pre-requisites*: experience with using basic computer software

*Required Materials*: laptop or access to some computing device

*No laptop?* You can borrow a Harvard Forest laptop (contact
  Manisha Patel)

Class Schedule
--------------

**June 1 (Monday)**

7:45-8PM: brief intro to ecological analyses.

- Why program? 
- Brief introduction to project management
- Connect to syllabus and course materials

**June 2 (Tuesday)**

*Before Class*

- Connect to Harvard Forest wireless
- Install R on your computer: http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/*
- Download the example project: https://github.com/HarvardForest/myProject/archive/master.zip

*9-10AM: Analytics and programming basics*

- Present the overarching analytics framework 
<!-- (Noble 2009 =  -->
<!--   document organization, task scheduling, data management, analytics -->
<!--   management, keeping an analytics notebook) -->
- Basic functions/operations and tasks (e.g., do simple calculations
on scalars and vectors)
- Objects = way to keep data in your memory
- Functions = name(arguments)
- Scripting and annotation = save your code and notes about code

*Post-Class Challenge*

- What's the area of a square with a side = 10 cm?
- What's the circumference of a circle with diameter 10 cm?

**June 4 (Thursday)*

*9-10AM: Data, Data and more Data!*
- Entering data by hand
- Manipulating vectors (sorting, ordering)
- Manipulating matrices = sorting and appending
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Inputting data (read.csv,read.table)
- Advanced data = lists
=======
- Data reading functions (read.csv,read.table)
- Working directory
- Advanced data (mode/class, data frames and lists)
>>>>>>> 2c44b1ae3012c0eacfd0140e158a0d8c54f6f843

*Post-Class Challenge*

- How does a circle's circumference change as it's diameter changes?
- Find a cool equation and play with it in R (e.g. E=mc^2)!

**June 9 (Tuesday)**

*9-10AM: Analysis*

- Plotting data overview
- Calculating basic statistics (mean and variance)
- Writing your own functions (se: input, process, output)
- What are packages? (e.g., *gplot*)
- Barplot with error bars

*Post-Class Challenge*

- Create a plot of how a circle's circumference chances as its
  diameter changes.

**June 16 (Tuesday)**

*9-10AM: Best Practices and Some Advanced Topics*

- Organizing code
- Getting data from the HF archives
- Versioning = github
- Loops and applys
- Simulating data = runif and rnorm
- Data and software ethics
- Data provenance
- Hackathon?

*Post-Class Challenge*

- Find and analyze an HF dataset
