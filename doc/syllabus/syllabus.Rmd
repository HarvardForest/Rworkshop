Ecological Analytics
====================

*Location*: Harvard Forest June 2015 9-10am EDT

*Instructor*: Matthew Lau (http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~matthewklau)

*Goal*: Students will learn how to use the R programming language for
 ecological analyses and gain experience:

- Managing analytical aspects of a project
- Inputting, manipulating and exporting data
- Statistical functions
- Plotting data patterns
- Coding and software best practices
- Getting more help, experience and practice

**Although statistics will be introduced very
briefly, this will not be a statistics class.**

*Pre-requisites*: experience with using basic computer software.
*Required Materials*: laptop or access to some computing device.


Calendar
--------

June 1 (Monday), 7:45-8PM: brief intro to ecological analyses.
- Why program? 
- Brief introduction to project management
- Connect to syllabus and course materials

June 2 (Tuesday), 9-10AM: Analytics and programming basics.
**Before Class**

- Connect to Harvard Forest Guest wireless*
- Install R on your computer: http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/*
- Download the example project: https://github.com/HarvardForest/myProject/archive/master.zip

**In Class**

- Introduction to analytics, the usefulness of programming and R
- Present the overarching analytics framework (Noble 2009 = document
  organization, task scheduling, data management, analytics
  management, keeping an analytics notebook)
- Basic functions/operations and tasks (e.g., do simple calculations
on scalars and vectors)
- Objects = way to keep data in your memory
- Functions = name(arguments)
- Scripting and annotation = save your code and notes about code

**Challenge**

- What's the area of a square with a side = 10 cm?
- What's the circumference of a circle with dimeter 10 cm?
- Find a cool equation and play with it in R (e.g. E=mc^2)!

June 4 (Thursday): Data management

**In Class**

- Data structure and spreadsheets
- Inputting and managing data overview
- Manipulating vectors (sorting, ordering)
- Manipulating matrices = sorting and appending
- Data reading functions (read.csv,read.table)
- Working directory
- Advanced data (mode/class, data frames and lists)

**Challenge**

- How does a circle's circumference change as it's diameter changes?

June 9 (Tuesday): Data analysis

**In Class**

- Getting data from the HF archives
- Calculating basic statistics (mean and variance)
- Scatterplots, Barplots and Histograms
- Components of the plot (axis, labels, colors, cex, etc...)
- Writing your own functions (se: input, process, output)
- Packages = gplot
- Barplot with error bars

**Challenge**

- Analyze an HF dataset

June 16 (Tuesday): Data, Programming and Research Tips and Best Practices 

- Modular Code = just make the wheel once
- Versioning = github
- Loops and applys
- Simulating data = runif and rnorm
- Data and software ethics
- Data provenance
- Hackathon?
