Programming for Reproducible Ecology in R
=========================================

<!-- library(rmarkdown);render('syllabus.Rmd',);render('syllabus.Rmd',output_format='pdf_document') -->

*Location*: Harvard Forest

*Instructors*: 

- Matthew Lau (http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~matthewklau)
- Luca Morreale (http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/luca-morreale)

*Goal*: Students will learn how to use the R programming language for
 ecological analyses and gain experience with:

- Managing data
- Exploring data patterns
- Statistical functions
- Coding and software best practices
- Getting more help, experience and practice

**Although statistics will be introduced very briefly, this will not be a statistics class.**

*Pre-requisites*: experience with using basic computer software

*Required Materials*: laptop or access to some computing device

*No laptop?* You can borrow a Harvard Forest laptop (contact
  Manisha Patel)

*Before Class*

- Install R: http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/*
- Install RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
- Download the example project: https://github.com/HarvardForest/myProject/archive/master.zip
