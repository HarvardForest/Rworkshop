[5] Overview: Scientific Workflow Lab 
http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~matthewklau/popper.png
- Simple project from data to code to analysis to figures
- Save Data to data directory
- Import data into R
- Check data and clean data (subset, re-assign and rename)
- Conduct a correlation analysis
- Create a bivariate plot
- Save the plot to results
- Packaging 

[5] Setup a new project directory on your desktop

[10] Indexing
- Salt shaker 
http://people.fas.harvard.edu/~matthewklau/salt_shaker1.jpg
- Concept, simple indexing (vector, list, matrix/dataframe)
On the board
- Accessing elements (e.g. x[1] and x[1:5])
- Skipping and "removing" elements (e.g. x[-1], x[c(-1,-2,-3,-4,-5)] and x[-1:-5])
- Re-assigning elements (e.g. x[5] <- 10 and x[1:5] <- c(5,5,5,5,5)
and x[1:5] <- 5)

[5] Getting Help! 
- (?, help, ??) 
- Broader R Community (google, stackoverflow)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38332621/subsetting-a-matrix-addressing-colnames

[9] Setup a new script in src with the following comments
## Import data into R
## Check data 
## Clean data (subset, re-assign and rename)
## Conduct a correlation 
## Create a bivariate plot
## Save the plot to results

[1] Set the working directory to your project's main folder

Once folks have this Matt and Luca will give them the data they're
going to use:
write.csv(iris[,1:2],file='~/Desktop/iris.csv',row.names=FALSE)

[5] Scripting BP 
http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/16-wrap-up/
- Short object names (avoid longer than 6 characters)
- "<-" for assignments
- Double quotes for character inputs to arguments
- Break lines after commas and group sections of code that make sense together
- Annotate to break into sections

[10] Scripting
- Import data
- Clean data for the following issues 
0. Change the next to last value in the first variable to 5.5
1. Remove the first 5 obs
- Conduct a correlation (use the help system to find the function)

[10] Basics of plotting
- base R plot
- Formatting arguments (cex)
- Labelling arguments
- Layering (points)
- Layering (lines)
- output types (pdf,jpeg)
- Graphics device
- dev.off()

[10] Scripting
- Create a plot
- Explore the plotting features
- Use help and stackoverflow
- Write out your plot to the results directory

[10] Surveys wrap-up
- Class survey
- Evening sessions
